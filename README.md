# Tool to decrypt AES-CBC-encrypted objects from etcd

This tool allows you to decrypt `aescbc` and `secretbox` encrypted data from a Kubernetes etcd.

## Description

Kubernetes allows you to [encrypt Secret data at rest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/), which means that the object data is stored in an encrypted form in etcd.

Once the `EncryptionConfiguration` is created and enabled with `--encryption-provider-config`, data is stored as follows in etcd:

```
"k8s:enc:<encryption-name>:v1:<provider-name>:<encrypted-data>"
```

* For `aescbc` encrypted data, the `<encrypted-data>` consists of a 32-bit IV, followed by the AES blocks (PKCS#7 padded).
* For `secretbox` encrypted data, the `<encrypted-data>` is encrypted with XSalsa20 and Poly1305.

The recommended way to decrypt this data is to start a `kube-apiserver` with the correct `EncryptionConfig` and then to query the API to decrypt and retrieve the data. However, in some cases this might not be feasible, which is why this tool has been created to directly decrypt the data without a `kube-apiserver`.

## Build and run

```
$ go build .
$ ./k8s-etcd-decryptor
```

## Usage

To decrypt a certain object from a Kubernetes etcd, proceed as follows:

1) To extract the an object from `etcd`, use the following `etcdctl get` command to set up the environment variables (often found in /etc/etcd/etcd.conf) and retrieve the base64-encoded `etcd` object using `etcdctl` (a `Secret` in this example):

   ```
   # source /etc/etcd/etcd.conf 
   # export ETCDCTL_API=3
   # etcdctl --cert=$ETCD_PEER_CERT_FILE --key=$ETCD_PEER_KEY_FILE --cacert $ETCD_TRUSTED_CA_FILE --endpoints=$ETCD_LISTEN_CLIENT_URLS get /kubernetes.io/secrets/simon-project/my-secret --write-out=json
   {"header":{"cluster_id":1535328224928523406,"member_id":10396734553733729853,"revision":30198,"raft_term":3},"kvs":[{"key":"L2t1YmVybmV0ZXMuaW8vc2VjcmV0cy9zaW1vbi1wcm9qZWN0L215LXNlY3JldA==","create_revision":28525,"mod_revision":28525,"version":1,"value":"azhzOmVuYzphZXNjYmM6djE6c2ltb246lvj7pYRT71cyo+aqLPjJ2kuvAOI4FghpUG5n405KRZOLnDU3EAw55jxDt+qAJPFArX7Jmp8wppRgdk7NE+3XiOCGnQBQWGkJX1irZ31DxotG4CfrxH4pJ0Agnmzw/e+bJAJGPO84SMFjrhInd14iseyErrfrG5s/dy0tEyDUtQMrVGMLkztYoELfBARK8+PP3H52oJmlM1rvU6jV09dbcQ=="}],"count":1}
   ```

2) Retrieve the base64-encoded encryption key ("secret") from the `EncryptionConfig` from your Control Plane Nodes. OpenShift stores it in `/etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml` or `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver-pod-<N>/secrets/encryption-config/encryption-config`, other distributions might store it in a different place.

   ```
   # cat /etc/origin/master/encryption-config.yaml 
   kind: EncryptionConfig
   apiVersion: v1
   resources:
     - resources:
     - secrets
     - configmaps
     providers:
     - aescbc:
         keys:
         - name: "simon"
           secret: 1vTaJ76Pak2oXFu5k0muTN7Uo+VZWsV9caFjz/Pc3x4=
     - identity: {}
   ```

Using the `value` from the first step and the `secret` from the second step, you can then use the program in this repository to decrypt the object:

```
$ ./k8s-etcd-decryptor

Enter base64-encoded etcd value: azhzOmVuYzphZXNjYmM6djE6c2ltb246lvj7pYRT71cyo+aqLPjJ2kuvAOI4FghpUG5n405KRZOLnDU3EAw55jxDt+qAJPFArX7Jmp8wppRgdk7NE+3XiOCGnQBQWGkJX1irZ31DxotG4CfrxH4pJ0Agnmzw/e+bJAJGPO84SMFjrhInd14iseyErrfrG5s/dy0tEyDUtQMrVGMLkztYoELfBARK8+PP3H52oJmlM1rvU6jV09dbcQ==

v1Secretv
T
simon-project"*$6567b48b-9f45-11ea-8fb6-fa163e827b272z
mysupersecretOpaque"
```

This will print the the object (a `Secret` in this case) data as a string, which is not very nice but works well for most use-cases.
